# File upload

I'm not sure how to go about this, although I think I know what might trip me up. I think attaching files to documents (perhaps via a `files` key on the document itself) is the smart idea. I don't know how I'm going to do authorization, but my first instinct is to use a random ID that I route to the file once I confirm credentials. Let's see how this pans out.

Write a file extension and use bdl to link.
