# Parcha

Parcha is a knowledge management app for the common man. It keeps your data in your hands and provides near infinte customizability through the extension engine. It's also open source!

## Notes on development
- In the future maybe I should think about mutexes or locks to make sure the `EXTENSIONS` object is accessed safely.
- Figure out a way to mount extension routes

## Interesting UI Patterns
- [ ] Sublime Merge click again to confirm popover
- [ ] ctrl+alt+shift+cmd for modifiers - use Raycast's hyper key
